# TheGame
Silly little game to see if I can actually create a game that integrates with Facebook,
the Apple Push Notification server, and AdMob.

This is nothing more than an iOS implementation of "The Game" as described in:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game)
   
While it could be played as a single-player "game," that really makes no sense.
It is meant to be played as a multi-player experience.

The game can be played against random players, Facebook friends, or a mixture thereof.

Although it will appear as though all of your opponents are in one big game, the reality
is that each of your opponents can have their own distinct set of opponents.  You will
not see each others' group of opponents.
