# PRIVACY POLICY

## Background

VMWishes is a hobby site, not a business!
The games, tools, code snippets, etc. developed under the VMWishes.com brand are not intended to turn any sort of profit.
We have no interest in monetizing your private information.
To this end, the only information collected is that which enhances the experience of using our products.

## What Information is Collected/Stored by *TheGame* ?

In order to active the game to play with others, the user must create a connection account.
There are three options provided:
- Facebook login
- Email address
- Anonymous

The user may opt to receive push notifications when other players have lost or quit the game. 
In this case, a device location ID will be collected.

### Internal UserID

All information collected on a user is tied to a userid generated by the game server.  
This ID is sent back to your app when your account but is never shared with other users.

### Username and Password

There is no attempt to verify that the username is the user's actual name (pseudonames and aliases are perfectly acceptable). The username is stored unencrypted in our database.
The password is stored in a hashed format in our database---never as plain text.

A user may elect to provide an email address as a mechanism for recovering a lost userid or password.  This email address will be stored along with the UserID.  It will be used solely 
for the purpose of userid recovery or password reset.

### Facebook Login

With the exception noted below, connection accounts created using Facebook login will 
request only your username, profile picture, and Facebook ID from Facebook.

If a user elects to play *TheGame* with Facebook friends, the game server will also request
your friend list from Facebook. Facebook will only return friends that have also registered their account with *TheGame* and have also elected to play with friends. The only information
retrieved about your friends' accounts and the only information that will be shared 
with your friends is name, profile picture, and Facebook ID.

The only information retrieved from Facebook that is stored in *TheGame* database is the Facebook IDs.

## What User Information is Generated?

The only information generated by *TheGame* is the UserID (see above) and the last time the user lost the game.  
The time of last loss is stored as number of seconds since 01-Jan-1972 00:00:00 GMT.

## What Information is Received from Other Sources?

The free version of *TheGame* uses Google's AdMob advertising service to help offset the cost of an Apple Developer plan.
While *TheGame* does not explicitly provide any information to AdMob nor receives information explicitly from AdMob, 
be aware that AdMob may collect information via the Google API.  You may wish to review [AdMob's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy).

## What Information is Shared with Others?

User information is shared only with opponents in the game.  
The only information shared with other players is name (either username or Facebook name),
profile picture (if using Facebook login), and the (GMT) time of last lost.

## Cookies

*TheGame* does not use any cookies for any reason.

## Information Collected on Children

*TheGame* does not collect any information about the age of its users.  
It cannot, therefore, distinguish between minors and adults.

## Security

All information collected by *TheGame* is stored in a MySQL database on the VMWishes.com server.
The userid and password for this database is **not** known to the mobile app.  It is known only
to the administrators of *TheGame* and the game server itself.

## Opting Out

A user can opt out of data collection by *TheGame* at any point through the app's settings.
The user will be given the option of dropping Facebook friends, Facebook login, or username/password
as applicable.

If both Facebook login and username/password are dropped, the account will be purged and all
data associated with the (internal) UserID will be deleted.

The user will be given the option of dropping silently or sending a notification that they are quitting the game.
In this case, their name will be sent one final time through a push notification to all their current opponents.
